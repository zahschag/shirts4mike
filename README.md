		<h1>Shirts 4 Mike: Treehouse project</h1>
		<h2>Build a Simple PHP application</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this project was to build a simple PHP application for a t-shirt selling website, the project was taken step by step, and explained how functions, variables, properties, classes, and loops work.
		</p>
		<p>On the next stage(currently working on it) we will integrate more functionality to the website, including pagination, error messages and better addressing.
